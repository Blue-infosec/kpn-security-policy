# KPN Security Policy created by the KPN CISO Office

## Content
The KPN Security Policy on physical security, information security, business continuity and privacy.

## Not published
The guideline documents and tools. The motivation is that we do not publish information that can be tied back to our internal processes as we consider this confidential information.

## Sharing is caring philosophy
We hope to inspire readers to learn about our choices and perhaps copy ideas. We are open for feedback to also learn from other experiences.
